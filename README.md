# Most code that needs explaining should be fairly well documented as I've spent about an hour and a half commenting things.

# I Did use the Unity UI Extensions for the infinite scroll and based the radial scroll on that. The curves for positioning/scale/movement can be tweaked for ages in editor to get whatever the designer would want. I tried to make it look as much like the reference image as possible. 

# I was a bit unsure about what to do for page two as I found it slightly difficult to understand the brief. There is an animated 3D model that animates when clicked and there is various UI throughout.

# Overall the bulk of the time was writing the radial scroll stuff. I tried to add some basic structure to how things would work if it were an actual application but given that I did this over 2.5 evenings after work some of it is the quick and easy way. Any questions please feel free to ask.

# I also tried to follow a basic code standard throughout but as with any code standard there are times where it doesn't get adhered to. See below.

# Code standard
* Class & Function names: UpperCamelCase
* Parameters: lowerCamelCase
* Local Variables: lower_case
* Private Member Variables: mUpperCamelCase
* Public Member Variable: UpperCamelCase
* Constants: SHOUTY_TEXT

Prefer readable code and descriptive names.  It should be clear what a function does from its name.
